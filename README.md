## Description

Krepagotchi is a virtual pet game where you take care of your own little Krepa. You can feed it, clean its home and provide medical treatment when sick.
You can also pet it or play with it (randomly selected ball game or bubble popping) in order to provide affection. Full hunger and zero affection levels as well as a dirty home will impact your pets health. If health reaches zero, your Krepa will fuse and detonate. When that happens you will be prompted with an info dialogue showing some text as well as date of birth and date of detonation, and the opportunity to restart with a new pet. The game has many cozy features and specials. It can be played as a web game or bundled as a standalone executable.
